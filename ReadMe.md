## IN GAME SAVING PROCEDURE
- Save before entering a loading screen/new cell. 
- Don't save after changing cells. (Wait a min or so to let stuff load first.) 
- Don't save in combat or in areas with many NPCs. 
- Don't save while many scripts are running, like during nsfw scenes. 
- Don't save scum, especially after dying. *If you die, let the Shadows of Skyrim system finish it's job. (Enable it in MCM if you didn't) 
- Don't load a different character without exiting to desktop and rebooting the game first. 
- Exit to desktop and reloading in is the best way to avoid issues. 
- Delete old saves or back them up somewhere else. 
- Run resaver when all else fails.
