Project Skyrim was curated by Charolas. Spending two and a half years tweaking, refining, and patching this list to make it into something truly special that has already left many with a great impression. Project Skyrim is still evolving and growing. Let us, as a community, have the most seamless and amazing experience possible with Skyrim!
