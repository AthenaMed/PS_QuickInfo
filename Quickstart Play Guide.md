## How to Start a New Game

Follow each step in [Project-Skyrim README](https://github.com/Charolas/PROJECT-SKYRIM/blob/main/README.md) for installation. After installing PS successfully, use MO2 (ModOrganizer.exe) in the Project Skyrim Folder to start the game. Click "Run" in the upper right corner.

> [!important] First Time Run
> 
>When you enter the game for the first time, be patient and wait for the window to pop up and load. The game requires loading a large number of resources, so this process takes some time. Once you're on the main screen, choose "New Game" to create your save.

Follow these instructions whenever you start a new play through: 

1. Start a new game and wait around 3-5 minutes (depending on your specs and FPS) to allow the scripts to load. If you skip this waiting time, things might break. This is crucial; don't skip the waiting time. Then proceed as usual.

2. To start the game, open your MCM menu and go into the first mod, "00.Skyrim Unbound." There, you can configure everything you need for your journey. On the first page of it, press "begin adventure" to spawn you in a room for character creation. After creating your character, press enter (or select the "continue" option in the message box) to spawn you in the world.

**OR**

2. Simply press enter to have everything random and automatically enter the character creation room.

>Open MCM/mod Configuration again, scroll down to "Shadow of Skyrim" and click it. Then click on "general," and then on "enable." Confirm the pop-up to close and wait. This adds a gameplay element that helps preserve your save file on death. See [About Death and Loading Saves](Quickstart%20Play%20Guide.md#About%20Death%20and%20Loading%20Saves) for more.

## Survival
PS (Project Skyrim) has a few survival based mods for immersion in the world.

### [Sunhelm Survival and Needs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39414)
SunHelm is a survival and needs mod that tries to stay as streamlined as possible, while still including a full set of features to work with. 
- Needs system's that include Hunger, Thirst, and Fatigue
- A hypothermia system has been added in 2.0.0.
- Seasons
- Support for Campfire (see below)
- Campfire Skilltree

### [Campfire](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/667)
Campfire is the most feature-rich stand-alone camping mod for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, created from Frostfall's immersive and detailed camping system.

- **Build a campfire** 
	- From a small, fragile spark to a roaring blaze, and use it to cook with a cooking pot (or just grill right over the flames), or sit with your followers around the fire. Large campfires uplift and inspire, granting bonuses to skill gain.  
  
- **Create and buy camping equipment** 
	- Using items in the world around you. Build tents, tanning racks, a portable enchanting kit, and more. Carry all of your extra gear in Campfire-added **backpacks** that dynamically display your bed roll, torch, cooking pot, axe, and water skin. Your followers (up to 3, plus one animal) will sit or sleep with you inside of your tent, or sit around a campfire with you. If your follower is a spouse, they will even cuddle up to you when sleeping in your tent (vanilla marriage system only).  
  
- **Search for resources** 
	- (Using **Harvest Wood ability**) to search the nearby area for deadwood and branches. Use these to build hatchets, arrows, and other useful creations. The new **Instincts** vision ability allows you to see creatures that make noise, smell the bodies of the dead (including the undead), and optionally show the direction toward your current quest target.  
  
- **Advance your skills** 
	- Using Campfire's unique Skill System, modeled after the base game perk system. Campfire contains the **Camping Skill**, which allows you to build longer-lasting campfires, find more resources, see more with the Instincts ability, and more.

## Combat
Regarding combat, PS (Project Skyrim) utilizes two core modules: Valhalla Combat and Plus Combat.

### [Valhalla Combat](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64741)
Primarily provides core mechanics such as Timed block, Stamina Edits, Stun & Execution, Projectile Block & Deflection.

### [Plus Combat](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/100915)
Fine-tunes and balances the mechanics of all prerequisite mods (such as Valhalla Combat and Chocolate Poise Plus). It refines the stamina system to make it more meaningful and form gameplay.

This combination brings a deep and interactive system to (melee) combat.

- **Stamina:**
	- Stamina management becomes a crucial aspect, as most actions require stamina. Once your stamina is depleted, you enter a fatigued state until it fully regenerates. Fatigue brings various debuffs to damage and poise. In the current version, you can still perform light attacks during fatigue, but you will suffer reduced damage.

- **Timed Block:**
	- Successful timed blocks do not consume SP (Stamina Points), and perfect timed blocks can even stagger the opponent, recovering all your SP.

- **Stagger System:**
	- Poise HP is influenced by the type of armor. For more information, refer to [Chocolate Poise](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/70478) and [Chocolate Poise Plus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/82091).

- **True HUD:**
	- In the default settings, True HUD is responsible for displaying Poise HP (the yellow bar). When Poise HP reaches 0, it triggers a stagger and restores Poise HP to the maximum, providing a period of complete immunity.

## About Death and Loading Saves

 Shadows of Skyrim is an alternative death mod. In other words, when you die, you don't truly die but get a resurrection and nemesis system similar to Shadows of Mordor/War. Failure is no longer the end but part of the process. Pick up your sword and seek revenge. This not only provides dynamic gameplay but also avoids a Skyrim issue: the save system.

Loading saves in-game is not favorable for long-term play due to script issues. 

Follow safer saving procedures:
- Save before entering a loading screen/new cell.
- Don't save while many scripts are running, like during nsfw scenes. 
- Don't save scum, especially after dying.
- Don't save after changing cells. (Wait a min or so to let stuff load first.) 
- Don't save in combat or in areas with many NPCs. 
- Don't save scum, especially after dying. *If you die, let the Shadows of Skyrim system finish it's job. (Enable it in MCM if you didn't) 
- Let the Shadows of Skyrim system finish its job if you die.
- Don't load a different character without exiting to desktop and rebooting the game first. 
- Exit to desktop and reloading in is the best way to avoid issues. 
- Delete old saves or back them up somewhere else. 
- Run resaver when all else fails.
