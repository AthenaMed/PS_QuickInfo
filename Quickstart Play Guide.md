Regarding combat, PS (Project Skyrim) utilizes two core modules: Valhalla Combat and Plus Combat.

- **Valhalla Combat:**
  - [Valhalla Combat](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64741) primarily provides core mechanics such as Timed block, Stamina Edits, Stun & Execution, Projectile Block & Deflection.

- **Plus Combat:**
  - [Plus Combat](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/100915) fine-tunes and balances the mechanics of all prerequisite mods (such as Valhalla Combat and Chocolate Poise Plus). It refines the stamina system to make it more meaningful and form gameplay.

This combination brings a deep and interactive system to (melee) combat.

- **Stamina:**
  - Stamina management becomes a crucial aspect, as most actions require stamina. Once your stamina is depleted, you enter a fatigued state until it fully regenerates. Fatigue brings various debuffs to damage and poise. In the current version, you can still perform light attacks during fatigue, but you will suffer reduced damage.

- **Timed Block:**
  - Successful timed blocks do not consume SP (Stamina Points), and perfect timed blocks can even stagger the opponent, recovering all your SP.

- **Stagger System:**
  - Poise HP is influenced by the type of armor. For more information, refer to [Chocolate Poise](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/70478) and [Chocolate Poise Plus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/82091).

- **True HUD:**
  - In the default settings, True HUD is responsible for displaying Poise HP (the yellow bar). When Poise HP reaches 0, it triggers a stagger and restores Poise HP to the maximum, providing a period of complete immunity.
