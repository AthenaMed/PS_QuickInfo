## Prep
If you did not clear previous download location, mods that did not change from last update, will use already downloaded files, which is making updating a lot faster than fresh install.

> [!important] Important!
> 
Keep in mind, that after update, all mods added by you, will be **DELETED**.
If you want to keep those mods, add **[NoDelete]** at the beginning of mod name.
